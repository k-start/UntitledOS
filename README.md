# UntitledOS
Hobby Operating System written in C++

## About
Untitled OS is an Operating System that I am building to expand my knowledge of both C++ and Operating Systems as a whole. There is no clear Aim for this OS and is not attempting to be compliant with anything. Maybe I will go back and rewrite things as I learn more.

### Current Features
- IRQs/ISRs
- Keyboard
- Custom shell with a couple of commands
- Physical Memory Manager
- Paging with page mapping

### Upcoming Features
- Kernel Heap management
- File System access
- Userspace with user processes

### Libraries
This project currently contains 2 custom build libraries. Libc and Y (liby)
- libc is a custom c implementation and will eventually cover enough to build c applications in our OS
- Y (liby) is for custom C++ like data structures that I feel like implementing in my own way

## Building
- Todo: write this section
